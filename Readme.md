# Icestorm Homebrew Tap
This is the a homebrew tap for the icestorm tools. Verilator, IcarusVerilog and Yosys are already part of homebrew-core, but these aren't. And we need them.

# Usage
`brew tap cloud-v/icestorm`

Then you can `brew install icestorm arachne-pnr`

# License

These formulas are derived from and are enabled by work of the Homebrew team, who we thank dearly.
